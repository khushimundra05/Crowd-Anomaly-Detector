# Crowd Anomaly Detection

**Description**  
This project detects abnormal events in crowds from video streams in real-time, such as violence, stampedes, sudden collapses, and vehicle intrusions. It uses a combination of spatial and temporal deep learning techniques to analyze video frames and sequences for anomalies.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning models for video analysis  
- **OpenCV** – Video processing and frame extraction  
- **NumPy / Pandas** – Data handling  
- **Streamlit** – Web interface for uploading videos and displaying results  

---

## **Features**
- Detects multiple types of crowd anomalies  
- Real-time video processing  
- User-friendly interface for testing videos
